# CAPE-python
A fast implementation of the CAPE algorithm for extracting planes only. This is based upon the paper: "Fast Cylinder and Plane Extraction from Depth Cameras for Visual Odometry" (2018) by Pedro F. Proen√ßa and Yang Gao. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02380v3.pdf

The authors own implementation can be found at:https://github.com/pedropro/CAPE
